# Tic-Tac-Teo-Game
A Tic Tac Toe game is a classic, two-player strategy game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to get three of their symbol (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends in a draw if all of the spaces on the grid are filled and there is no winner.

Here are the basic rules of the game:

Players take turns placing their symbol on the grid.
Players must place their symbol in an empty space on the grid.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all of the spaces on the grid are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
A Tic Tac Toe game can be implemented in many different ways, such as using a command-line interface, a graphical user interface, or through networked play. The repository you mentioned may contain code for one of these implementations of the game.
